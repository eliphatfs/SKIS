### Folders
- `central`: Central service to be hosted. SKIS hosts itself at `https://skis.flandre.info/central/`.
- `client`: Client side programs that directly talk to SKIS.
- `client_tools`: Client side programs that may be used together with SKIS. These are basically utility scripts or applications so they can also be used stand-alone.
